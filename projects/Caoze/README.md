For course EN.580.171.12.IN26: Neural Network From Scratch

Simplistic CNN constructed from scratch using only Numpy

Modulate to be altered for different dataset. 

Goal is for a tunable convolutional neural network, with a image segmentation pipline.

Data processing functions are aimed for image segmentation; particularly for MNIST number dataset.

May not be comparable to pytorch models, but should demonstrate efficiency to a certain degree.
